				<h><u>VISION STATEMENT</u></h>
				<p>True Astrology is a satirical fortune-telling app</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class= "textbox">
				<h>What the project is:</h>
				<p>True Astrology will provide comically negative fortune telling, based on provided common spiritualistic indicators, as a satirical response to the plethora of conventional fortune-telling options. Initially True Astrology will require the user to enter their star sign, which will then be used to give the user a comically negative prediction. Similar to other fortune-telling options, our application will outwardly present itself as a “legitimate” prediction option. The intent behind this is to trick the user into thinking of True Astrology is a conventional astrology application until the prediction itself is viewed.</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="textbox">
				<h>Users:</h>
				<p>True Astrology’s demographic is mainly adults wishing to point out the ridiculousness of astrological predictions by showing a similar system of predicting with vaguely negative results instead of positive ones usually used. Along with this, the app can provide a medium for people wishing to do practical jokes with other people who are interested in astrology, allowing for the user to pretend the terrible generated prediction is legitimate.</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="textbox">
				<h>What makes it valuable:</h>
				<p>True Astrology’s primary purpose is comedic relief. On an individual level, True Astrology will be able to provide a new medium for comedy to its users. Furthermore, the app also opens up social avenues for people to play practical jokes on each other. Albeit comical, True Astrology can also be thought-provoking to its users, promoting the questioning of the utility of conventional astrology predictions. It is designed to discourage users from letting arbitrary factors (such as the stars’ alignment) decide one’s course of life.</p>
				<br>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="textbox">
				<h>Success Criteria:</h>
				<p>Given True Astrology’s comedic nature, we believe the user’s feedback on our predictions is the most major success criteria. In that, the app would be considered successful if the generated predictions can be altered to the user’s comedic threshold. Furthermore, if the user logs back in at least 3 times and generates at least 3 predictions, this would also contribute towards True Astrology’s success criteria.</p>

				<h>The Team:</h>
				<p>
				Jethro Swanson - Learned a lot more about implementing databases within android studio and what an arduous process it can be. And a bit more about the android studio environment in general.
				<br>
				<br>
				Muhammad Usman Asif - Skills gained: One of the most important skills I’ve gained during this course is understanding the importance of SOLID principles. Although I’d studied them before, seeing their application greatly broadened my understanding of app development. Furthermore, COMP3350 was my first exposure to GitLab. This not only helped me understand how to derive tasks from features we want to implement, but also made the process of app development much less overwhelming.
				<br>
				<br>
				Eyal Zingerman - throughout the course I learned a lot about the fundamentals of working as part of a team in a programming environment. Furthermore I learned a lot of new concepts about development, and even though I subconsciously implemented them before, now I know exactly what they are, how and where to implement them, and how to optimize them.
				<br>
				<br>
				Meshvi Patel - This course has proven to be one of the most interesting concepts I have learnt in Computer Science. The start of this course, came across SDLC for the first time. While going through course topics and using them to build this app enhanced my learning abilities. Android Studio and Gitlab were the core of this, I developed a great undertsanding of both. Lastly, working in a group helped me learn a lot more different skills and made great friends.
				<br>
				<br>
				Jiaxuan Yang - In this project, I gained experience with distributed version control through GitLab. I deepened my understanding of the overall application structure, encompassing data, logic, and UI, successfully interconnecting them. Throughout the development process, I also applied various development principles, further enhancing my skills and knowledge.

				<h>On Development:</h>
				<p>Working with a team can be difficult. Ensuring that consistent high quality communication is up-kept as well as managing
				time expectations for parts of the project to allow everything completed in an efficient manner while also actually creating
				the project is a hefty workload. However I believe it is exactly that, the communication, that allowed us to do so much with our
				project. We managed to advance the implementation of our application, quickly moving several features originally planned for iteration 3
				into iteration 2. And while the extra workload did mean barely completing everything we had for iteration 2 we were still outperforming
				our original expectations. Going forward, I plan on continuing this focus on good communication within groups I work in as that that
				seems essential to allowing a team to flourish</p>
				<br>

			<div class="textbox">
				<h>What I would change:</h>
				<p>While overall our process was good and our end product is close to what we originally wanted, if I could
				change one thing about or development process starting out, it would be limiting our expectations for what we can accomplish.
				We initially had very high expectations for what we could accomplish and started out taking on a bit more than we could
				handle. While it mostly worked out, I think limiting what we tried to accomplish and possibly cutting a feature or two would allow
				us to create a slightly more polished end product with a little less rushing at the end.</p>

				<h>Major Functionality:</h>
				<p>Allows the user to enter their name and star sign then generate predictions. They can generate standard star sign predictions (with the option to make predictions harsher or more mild upon receiving a prediction) and these predictions are customized to the user's star sign to give it a more personalized feel. The user can also generate a tarot prediction where a random tarot card is pulled and an associated prediction is given, again customized with the user's information to give it a more personalized feel. The final functionality is allowing the user to see statistics about themselves and how many predictions they have generated, and clearing these values if they wish to try a fresh start of the app.</p>
